**Bike Sharing Prediction 🚴‍♂️📊**

📌 Project Overview

This project predicts bike rental demand using machine learning regression models. The dataset includes various features affecting bike rentals, such as weather conditions, time of day, and seasonal trends. The goal is to build an accurate model to help bike-sharing services optimize their operations.

📊 Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Python
- ML Algorithms: Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost Regressor
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, pickle
- Testing Environment: Command Prompt (UI yet to be developed)

🛠 Project Workflow

1) Data Preprocessing:
- Loaded dataset and handled missing values
- Feature engineering and encoding categorical variables
- Data normalization and splitting into training & testing sets

2) Model Training:
- Implemented Random Forest Regressor and XGBoost Regressor
- Tuned hyperparameters to improve performance

3) Model Saving:
- Trained models are saved as .pkl files for future use

4) Testing:
- The models are tested via the command prompt

🔧 Future Enhancements
- Develop a UI for better user interaction
- Experiment with more regression models
- Deploy the model using FastAPI or Flask
